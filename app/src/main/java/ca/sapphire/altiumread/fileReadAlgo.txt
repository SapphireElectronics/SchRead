Algorithm for reading Compound Document

Header
- Read header into Header class (512 bytes)
    - relevant info:
        - make sure it's a compound document by checking file identifier.
        - sector size (512)
        - short sector size (64)
        - number of sectors in sector allocation table
        - ID of first directory sector
        - ID of first short sector SSAT (-2 if there is no short sector table)
        - length of SSAT
        - ID of first master sector MSAT (-2 if there is no master sector table other than first 109)
        - length of MSAT
        - minimum standard stream size
        - first 109 IDs of the MSAT

MSAT
- MSAT starts in header and continues to ID of first MSAT if there is one
- currently do not support any MSAT other than in the Header

SAT
- read all sectors specified in the MSAT
- currently MSAT is only contained in header, therefore 109 max
- read a sector if the MSAT value is not equal -1
    - this is the same as the number of sectors value read in the header ...

SSAT
- read all sectors specified in the MSAT
- ID is stored in the header.

DIR
- lookup Sector for root directory entry from Header
- build directory sector chain starting at
- read root directory
